this is a page for dumping a rough thought and a way for agents to help refine / improve / discredit

there should be different sections of the page that explore and report the idea in different ways

there should be some kind of highlighter pen, different colors mean different actions
- important, keep this
- bad idea, don't use this
- ill defined, expand this

maybe an action would be to make a new window or tab to help drive out that sub requirement


# secions of the page

## chat section
this is where the user writes thoughts, gets chat style feedback

## final suggested
this is a box, or list of boxes of final requirements based on everything else on the page

## personalities
have custom agents role playing specific personalities outputing their feed back

each of their outputs should be chat style boxes, so the user could give feedback

### types
- **internet troll**: kind of rude, picks it apart.  basically coming up with reasons why it won't work
  - could have sub types that focus on different parts:
    - input
    - reason for being
    - something like that already exists

- **edge case**: tries to think of things that could break the design

- **unit test**: comes up with unit tests and expected results

- **technical writer**: takes text and makes a more professional markdown version.  doesn't make up new, just pretties up what's there


## drawing / diagram

a way to draw circles, boxes, text and draw lines connecting them


## links to supporting material

point to folders, websites that help describe what you're talking about
- repos
- meeting logs
- documentation dumps
